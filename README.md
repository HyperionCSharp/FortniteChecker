## FORTNITE CHECKER README.md
THIS FORTNITE CHECKER WILL UTILIZE OAUTH2.0 ENDPOINT BY CALLING THE NECESSARY PERMISSIONS.
THIS IS THE FIRST CHECKER THAT WILL USE THIS "DEPRECATED" GRANT TYPE SINCE
AXENTA WHICH WAS PRODUCED BY CUPS.

I WILL UPDATE THIS CHECKER A FEW TIMES BUT AFTER A FEW UPDATES IT WILL GO TO PAID UPDATING.

**THIS IS BEING CODED LIVE EVERYDAY SO UPDATES WONT BE IMMEDIATE.**

THE PERMISSIONS SET WILL ALLOW FULL ACCESS TO READ/WRITE/CREATE ABILITIES ACROSS EOS.

THE CHECKER WILL BE CODED FOR TWO THINGS
1. Brute Force
2. Skin Checking

I WILL ALSO ADD INCREMENTAL PARSING SO YOU CAN HAVE FILES WITH ACCOUNT SKINS IN PICTURE FORM SO YOU CAN POST IT ON DISCORD LMAO.

BRUTE FORCE FIRST BEFORE GOING AHEAD AND CHECKING SKINS AS THE USER WILL STAY AUTHENTICATED IF YOUR CONFIG FILE CONTAINS
REFRESH_TOKEN = true; IF YOU ARE NOT AUTHENTICATED WITH THE OAUTH ENDPOINT IT WILL ASK YOU TO RUN BRUTE FORCE FIRST.

IF YOU WANT TO CHECK MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS SET REFRESH_TOKEN = false.
A NEW SESSION WILL BE CREATED EACH TRY. A FILE WITH ALL WORKING ACCOUNTS WILL BE CREATED IN THE LOCAL DIRECTORY.

I WOULD ADVISE TO SET STARTING THREADS AT 50-100 TO KEEP TIME OUTS LOW.

IF THE CHECKER THROWS A ERROR SCREEN DURING BRUTE FORCE IT MEANS YALL FAGS HAVE BEEN USING IT TOO MUCH SLOW TF DOWN!!! :))
THIS IS THE ONLY ERROR THE CHECKER CAN THROW ON ITS OWN.

IF THE CHECKING ERRORS START GOING ABOVE 1000 PROXIES ARE DEAD OR BANNED. (MINIMUM OF 500)

IM ACTUALLY MAKING CORRECT CPM (Checks Per Minute) CALCULATIONS NOT MULTUPLYING THREADS BY 60 :/

THIS CHECKER **NEEDS** ROTATABLE PROXIES.

P.S IF YALL LIKE THIS I MIGHT BUILD THE UI VERSION.
